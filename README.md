# Queries Comparison

You have a dataset of sails and you wannt to know which seller is third spot in sales. How would you write the query?

In this project I show 3 queries which gives the same result, but with their performances totally diferent.

To build this project I use MySQL running in docker and DBeaver interface. If you want to reproduce this project you can follow the intallation steps in this link: https://medium.com/@edu18ds/running-mysql-in-container-docker-and-setting-dbeaver-5f9e5781649d

The dataset and scripts are in this repository.
